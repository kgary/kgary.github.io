<h2><strong>Praying the Chaplet of Divine Mercy</strong> </h2>
<p>1. Our Father</p>
<p>  2. Hail Mary<br />
  </p>
<p>3. The Apostles’ Creed<br />
  I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and  earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the  Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was  crucified, died and was buried; He descended into hell; on the third day He  rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right  hand of God the Father almighty; from there He will come to judge the living  and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the  communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and  life everlasting. Amen.<br />
  </p>
<p>4. The Eternal Father<br />
  Eternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and  Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for  our sins and those of the whole world.<br />
  </p>
<p>5. On the 10 Small Beads of Each Decade<br />
  For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and  on the whole world.<br />
  </p>
<p>6. Repeat for the remaining decades<br />
  Saying the &quot;Eternal Father&quot; (4) on the &quot;Our  Father&quot; bead and then 10 &quot;For the sake of His sorrowful Passion&quot;  (5) on the following &quot;Hail Mary&quot; beads.<br />
