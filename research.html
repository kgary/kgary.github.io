                                        <p>
                                          My general area of research is software engineering; within this field I am currently interested in Agile and Lean Software Engineering, Open Source Software, Software Engineeringh Education, and software engineering for educational technology and for healthcare applications.</p>
                                          My research methods are use-inspired, meaning I look for new contexts of use for software technologies, and adapt or discover how software engineering principles apply. Therefore my work tends to be multidisciplinary and evolutionary; multidisciplinary in my collaborations, evolutionary in that my approach is to start with specific problems and work towards more general methods.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
					I am presently most active in agile and lean software engineering, re-examining traditional software engineering axioms in the context of a new way of doing software. To this end my students have worked on Agile Regression Testing, Technical Debt impact on open source software projects, and how the principles of flow apply in open source. I also remain active in all areas however, with funded projects in educational technology and healthcare.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        I am also engaged in the scholarship of teaching and learning, specifically in the context of software engineering education. A decade ago I created the Software Enterprise as both a hybrid project-based pedagogy for accelerating contextual understanding and industry preparedness of our students, and as an encapsulated set of modules for practical training of software engineering skills for students. The Enterprise now forms the project spine of the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Software Engineering degree at ASU. I am currently examining how Agile approaches can improve the way we teach and learn in an on-demand world.</p>

                                                        That change is all around us - from technology change, software engineering practices change, and most importantly how our student learners change. To that end I believe

							    <p>I believe in use-inspired research and in applied research that impacts individuals for the better. For this reason I have worked extensively in education but also in healthcare. In the past I have worked in image-guided and robotic surgery (see below) and in mobile health (mHealth) research. I am no longer active in these specific areas, but am engaged in an exciting NIJ-funded project on developing a Bone Atlas of Skeletal Abuse of the Elderly with PI Katelyn Bolhofner on ASU's West Valley Campus. We hope to put this platform out for beta test in Spring/Summer 2025!</p>
