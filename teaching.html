                                    <div class="col-md-8">
                                        <p>Mom always said I should teach. Going back to elementary school I was always helping the other kids in class, and took personal pleasure in seeing the enlightment on their faces at the moment something made sense. It is the same way today. I enjoy the time with my students, I root for them, and I still take pleasure when I see the rewards they gain from learning. They often think I am tough on them, but actually I am quite proud of the young adults who come through our SER programs. Many are first-generation college students, online students, and face challenges that make me respect their efforts to further themselves through advanced education.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>In the classroom I try to blend conceptual foundations with cutting-edge practices. I teach in the area of Software Engineering, creating a pedaogical approach and a set of curricular modules known as the Software Enterprise. The goal of the Enterprise is to rapidly integrate contextualized knowledge so that students not only learn what they need to know <em>now</em>, but learn that software engineering is not a prescriptive, formulaic discipline; the ability to understand what will add value in a given situation represents the best the discipline can expect from its engineers right now.
                                        </p>
					<p>
					Research and practice informs teaching, and I particularly blend my experiences in both academia and industry to inform my students of modern trends in Software Engineering. I presently lead the graduate core course in Software Engineering for incoming graduate students, and teach an elective on Software Agility, teaching Agile, Lean, DevOps. microservice architectures, observability, and more.
                                        I also teach courses in Web and Mobile technologies. Here I draw on my experiences from industry, consulting, and my professional contacts. I am constantly revising course materials in this area to keep pace with the technology, and evolving best practices. I am always incorporating new software development methodologies into the classroom, like Agile and Open Source.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The classroom is a simulation for the profession, and in some ways for life. I believe students should be allowed to experiment, fail, struggle, recover, adapt, and evolve - to gain enlightenment. I often employ different types of assessment and feedback strategies (not just grades) so that students are guided toward greater understanding, not just temporarily acquiring some bucket of knowledge.
                                        </p>
